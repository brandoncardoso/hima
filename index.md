This is Hima, a simple Jekyll theme with the goal of being accessible to everyone. It follows [The A11Y Project's accessibility guidelines](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist). It comes with a light and dark colour scheme, as well as an adaptive colour scheme that switches between light and dark depending on your OS/browser settings.

For how to install and other information, check out the [Hima repository on GitHub](https://github.com/brandoncardoso/hima).
